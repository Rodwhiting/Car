Arduino library for IWM Rocket car mobile robot

The intent of this library is to make it a lot simpler to program the IWM Rocket Car.

Rather than have to write code against the AF_MOTOR, NewPing and Servo libraries, this library provides a higher level of abstraction.

NB Ensure that the Servo, NewPing and AFMotor class are already imported and in your Arduino/Library directory.

AF_Motor can be found here : http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield/library-install

NewPing can be found here : https://code.google.com/p/arduino-new-ping/

Servo is included with the Arduino IDE.

See the sample Sketch in the examples directory for details on how to use it.

Hope you find it useful and have fun!

Steve.
